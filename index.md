---

Mathematics Cell is a part of Toulouse Biotechnology Institute Bio & Chemical Engineering ([TBI](http://www.toulouse-biotechnology-institute.fr/en/index.html)). It is focused on mathematical modeling of biochemical and microbial systems.

## What Mathematics Cell proposes?

We work by project. A researcher or engineer of TBI of elsewhere can propose an idea of a joint project where MathsCell can bring:

 - our competence in mathematical modeling;
 - (co-)developing scientific software (R, Python, C++, ...);
 - (co-)editing scientific papers with mathematical component based on our joint project.
 
## How to create a joint project?

 1. After discussing about purpose and main ideas of a project candidate, MathsCell will do a short feasibility study of the project;
 2. If the project is estimated as feasible, MathsCell edits a project proposal where project steps, contribution of the parties and so on are defined;
 3. If our partner accepts it, the project can start.
 
## Are there particular requirements/conditions for projects?

 - A project should enter in the scope of MathsCell scientific activities.
 - If a software will be developed, it should be distributed under OpenSource license.
 - If a paper is published based on our common project, MathsCell staff contributed to the project should be in co-authors.
 - Our partners are asked for a financial participation which will depend on project's workload.
 
## Our past/current projects

 - **[IsoSolve](https://github.com/MetaSys-LISBP/IsoSolve)**, a project with [MetaSys](http://www.toulouse-biotechnology-institute.fr/en/research/molecular-physiology-and-metabolism/metasys.html) team of TBI. The goal was to propose a unified framework for NMR/MS measurements on isotopically labeled metabolites. [Preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.08.430771v1).
 - **Influx2020**, a project with [MetaToul/Metabolic network](http://www.toulouse-biotechnology-institute.fr/en/technology_platforms/metabolomics-fluxomics.html) about adapting [influx_si](https://metasys.insa-toulouse.fr/software/influx/) software to high throughput experimental context.
 - **G3Mclass**, a project with Dr. Marina Guvakova, researcher in the University of Pennsylvania. The goal of the project is to develop a classifier for fine exploring of metabolic markers.
 - **[MetaboHub2](https://www.metabohub.fr/home.html)**, we participate in Workpackage 3 Task 4 (flux modeling) of this national-wide french consortium.
 
## Software we developed
 - [influx_si](https://metasys.insa-toulouse.fr/software/influx/) metabolic flux/concentration estimation based on isotopic measurements;
 - [IsoSolve](https://github.com/MetaSys-LISBP/IsoSolve) a unified framework for NMR/MS isotopic measurements;
 - [Deriv](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Deriv) symbolic differentiation of R code for mathematical expressions;
 - [rmumps](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rmumps) an R wrapper for [MUMPS library](http://mumps.enseeiht.fr/index.php?page=home) for sparse linear system solving;
 - [r2sundials](https://cran.r-project.org/package=r2sundials) an R wrapper for [Sundials library](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/) for ODE/sensitivity problem solving;
 
## Staff
